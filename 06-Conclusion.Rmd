# Conclusion  
- Will discuss the different models, and what they each mean, then chose the best one that is most representative of the data that I believe will have the highest predictive power. 

## Model 1: Entire Data Set 
- Looking at the z-statistics, volatility and beta are statistically significant, while price to book is not, at an alpha level of 0.05.
- For every one unit change in the beta, the log odds of being in the min vol index decrease by 1.92. 
- The odds ratio for beta is 0.15.
- For every one unit change in the vol, the log odds of being in the min vol index decrease by 0.025. 
- The odds ratio for vol is 0.98.
- For every one unit change in the price to book, the log odds of being in the min vol index decrease by 0.00036. 
- The odds ratio for beta is 0.99.

## Model 2: Monthly

## Model 3: Panel Regression
